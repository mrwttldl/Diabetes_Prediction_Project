 ## :file_folder:  Business Problem
The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA.
Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older living in Phoenix, USA.

It consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables.

Target variable "outcome" :
1 = diabetes test result being positive,
0 = indicates negative.

I want to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified.
